# wenlan-server reference

Module map and RB-01 profiling flag reference. Read the active `AGENTS.md` first and
load this file only when the task touches the corresponding area.

Applies to agents working under `crates/wenlan-server/`. Read alongside root
`AGENTS.md`, which takes precedence on any topic not covered here.

## Key Modules (`crates/wenlan-server/src/`)

Route modules follow the file name: `*_routes.rs` owns the handlers for that surface and exposes one or more `TrackedRouter` registration helpers, which `router.rs` composes. Where a module has two or more helpers it is because their composition positions are separated and must stay that way. Read the directory for the current set.

The modules whose job is not evident from the name:

| Module | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `main.rs` | Binary entry — daemon startup plus internal maintenance commands, tracing init, port binding with existing-daemon fallback, `MemoryDB::new`, LLM provider init, background tasks, `axum::serve` |
| `state.rs` | `ServerState` with `db: Option<Arc<MemoryDB>>`, `shutdown`, `bound_port`, the LLM handles (`llm`, `api_llm`, `synthesis_llm`, `external_llm`), `reranker` + `reranker_status`, `prompts`, `tuning`, `quality_gate`, `write_signal`, `maintenance_coordinator`, `ingest_batcher`, `repair_root`, `presence_root`, `lint_config`. `SharedState = Arc<RwLock<ServerState>>` |
| `router.rs` | Axum composition root — assembles the module-owned registration helpers plus the remaining inline registrations, then applies the truth/security/lifecycle layers |
| `routes.rs` | General endpoints: health, status, search/context, diagnostics, recent activity, steep/distill |
| `memory_routes.rs` | Memory CRUD/search/enrichment, classification, statistics, scheduler-handoff, rerank, attribution, update, revision, contradiction tests |
| `ingest_batcher.rs` | Request-level coalescer for concurrent `/api/memory/store` — folds QualityGate in-line, async classify/extract, passes enrichment + hint through in the response |
| `scheduler.rs` | Background periodic tasks (distill cycles, distillation, the reconcile/backfill sweeps gated by the `WENLAN_ENABLE_*` flags) |

## Manual RB-01 profiling flags

These flags control ignored, target-Mac profiling tests; they are not daemon runtime settings and must not be set in normal service configuration.

| Flag | Contract |
|---|---|
| `WENLAN_RB01_BASELINE` | Set to `1` to opt into the five-minute daemon-off resource baseline test. |
| `WENLAN_RB01_THERMAL_HELPER` | Optional path to the frozen helper executable that prints the macOS `ProcessInfo.thermalState` raw value; the test falls back to `/usr/bin/swift` when absent. |
| `WENLAN_RB01_CALIBRATION_LOAD_DUTIES` | Comma-separated synthetic-load duty percentages, each `1..=100`, with a total cap of `300`; must be supplied together with the CPU band. |
| `WENLAN_RB01_CALIBRATION_CPU_BAND` | Required `min:max` observed system-CPU percentage band for a calibrated profile; must be supplied together with load duties. Outside the band, the test records a skipped calibration and performs no inference. |

## Product telemetry flag

| Flag | Contract |
|---|---|
| `WENLAN_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` | Set to `1` to make product telemetry unavailable: the daemon reports telemetry as unavailable and does not record or send operation counters, even when persisted consent is enabled. When unset, telemetry remains available only in non-debug builds with an initialized HTTP client. |
