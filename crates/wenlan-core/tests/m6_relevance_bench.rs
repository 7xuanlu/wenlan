//! Frozen-corpus gate for the M6 relevance benchmark.
//!
//! C0 shipped the corpus and this target's reproducibility proof; C1 adds the
//! two count gates that consume it. The ordering was deliberate: §8.6's count
//! limits are hard pass/fail gates, and a gate that arrives after the code it
//! gates has never once failed. The proof C0 carries is **corpus
//! reproducibility**: a reviewer regenerates the corpus byte-for-byte, and a
//! mismatch makes the bench refuse to run rather than report a number nobody
//! can compare against.
//!
//! **S0-99 governs every number below: a benchmark failure stops for a
//! Sol-reviewed contract amendment and may not be answered by tuning a
//! constant.** `R-BENCH-Q` (4) and `R-BENCH-ROWS` (512) are frozen. If a sweep
//! breaches them, the thing that moves is the sweep — `SWEEP_ENDPOINTS_PER_TURN`
//! is the parameter the contract left free, and it exists precisely so the
//! frozen ones never have to.
//!
//! `R-BENCH-MAX`/`P50`/`P99` are wall-clock and are **not** asserted here:
//! §8.6 rules the count limits into CI and leaves the timing ones to a local
//! receipt under S0-98's specified conditions (warm cache, one evaluation at a
//! time, no concurrent refinery turn), which a hosted runner does not provide.
//! The `sweep_turn_*_ms` fields the receipt prints are also not `R-BENCH-MAX`:
//! that limit times the *route evaluation* over `m6_adjacency`/`m6_pair_stats`,
//! and C1 builds those tables' writer, not their reader.
//!
//! ## STOP: `R-BENCH-ROWS` is breached, and this is an S0-99 amendment
//!
//! The prior receipt in this comment was measured against a corpus whose hub
//! groups could not reach the top-64 cut: `M6_HUB_DEGREES` set each hub's root
//! count while `hub_weight(d)` reads pages touched, so every group's page
//! degree came from a fanout drawn `1..=15`, `hub_weight` returned exactly
//! `1.0` for all 12,000 groups, and the `64/d` branch never executed. Those
//! numbers measured a sweep that never met a hub. They are withdrawn, not
//! updated.
//!
//! Against the corrected corpus the count gate does not pass:
//!
//! ```text
//! bounded turn 46 breached its budget:
//!   M6 relevance evaluation materialized 513 rows; cap is 512
//! ```
//!
//! **Per S0-99 the response is not to move 512.** It is also not to lower
//! `SWEEP_CANDIDATE_WINDOW`, the parameter the contract left free, and the
//! margin is what says so: one row over, from a turn that packed a single
//! endpoint. `pack_within_budget` always returns at least one endpoint — a
//! turn that reserves its way to zero work never converges — so an endpoint
//! whose own groups project past the whole budget is admitted regardless of
//! the window, and shrinking the window cannot exclude it. Bounding one
//! endpoint's work is a design change, which is exactly the amendment S0-99
//! reserves to a reviewed decision rather than to whoever is holding the
//! failing test.
//!
//! The scan gap the withdrawn receipt described is still real and still
//! unfixed in `candidate_endpoints`: it builds `support` over the whole space
//! before `stale`'s `LIMIT` cuts to a handful of endpoints, so per-turn cost
//! tracks corpus size while the decoded-row instrument that gates it does not
//! — the defect S0-95 names in its own text, "a query that scans a million
//! rows and returns 512". That pass is now load-bearing rather than merely
//! unoptimized: selecting a co-supported page that has no pair row at all is
//! what closes the incremental-≠-full hole, and it cannot be answered from an
//! index on `m6_pair_stats`. `groups_touching` did take the pushdown, since
//! its endpoints are already known.
