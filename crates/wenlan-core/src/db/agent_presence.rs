//! Agent presence recorded from the read path.
//!
//! A tool that only searches never reaches `check_agent_for_write`, so the
//! Connections list could not tell "added but never used" from "working".
//! A read that names an agent now records that the agent was seen.
//!
//! A read must not grant write trust. A name the daemon has never written for
//! resolves to `"unknown"` (search only) on reads, and registration on the
//! write path defaults to `"full"`. So a row created here starts at
//! `"unknown"` with `memory_count = 0` and `updated_at = created_at`, and
//! never calls `register_agent` or `touch_agent`. The first write promotes it
//! in one conditional UPDATE (`promote_untouched_read_agent`) that only
//! applies while that marker still holds.
