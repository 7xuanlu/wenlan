/// which means an insert that stays silent does not fail; it asserts the row is
/// a concept page. Every page written between migration 89 and this rule did

///
/// The Overview is recognised by title, matching migration 89's own backfill:
/// its `creation_kind` is 'research', indistinguishable from any other research
/// page, and the title is reserved only among live pages. Everything else
/// follows `creation_kind`, with 'distilled' and 'research' both landing on
/// 'concept'.
///
/// One disagreement with the stored column survives on purpose, and it is the
/// reason no reader may route on `kind` yet. Migration 89 folded
/// `creation_kind='imported'` onto 'source' but never `'source'` itself, and it
/// wrote a fold-ledger row for every page it saw — so migration 107, which
/// skips any page the ledger already ruled on, leaves those rows where 89 put
/// them. A page imported before 89 therefore still stores 'concept' while this
/// rule says 'source'. Size the gap on a real vault with `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
/// pages p JOIN page_kind_fold_ledger l ON l.page_id = p.id WHERE
/// p.creation_kind = 'source' AND p.kind = 'concept'`; closing it belongs with
