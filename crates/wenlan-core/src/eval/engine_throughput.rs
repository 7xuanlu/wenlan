//! On-device continuous-batch **slot-backfill** throughput benchmark + KV-reuse
//! correctness oracle (L7 manual, needs the GPU + a downloaded GGUF model —
//! `#[ignore]`d so it never runs in CI).
//!
//! Wires the measured engine-perf speedup into the eval harness. The on-device
//! enrichment batch is decode-bound (`[batch_timing]` measured ~40% prefill /
//! ~59% decode): a continuous batch mixes short outputs (classify ~20 tok) with
//! long ones (entity ~100 tok), so decode width drains raggedly M→1 as the short
//! ones finish first. Slot backfill keeps all M slots full from a queue, holding
//! decode width near M until the queue drains.
//!
//! Two GPU tests:
//! - [`run_backfill_throughput_ab`] contrasts the **same total work** scheduled
//!   two ways: OFF = the queue in M-sized chunks (one call per chunk, ragged
//!   drain), ON = the whole queue in one call (the engine backfills freed slots).
//!   The headline is the wall-clock ratio `OFF / ON`.
//! - [`first_grounding_violation`] is the KV-reuse **correctness oracle**. Byte
//!   equivalence is the WRONG oracle for batched GPU inference — it is confounded
//!   by per-request sampler seeds (`42 + request_index`, which reslicing changes)
//!   and by batch-shape float non-determinism flipping near-tied tokens; both
//!   produce benign reorderings of identical content. The real backfill risk is
//!   different: a slot reused without clearing its KV would make a request attend
//!   to a PREVIOUS occupant's context and emit *that* prompt's entities. So each
//!   request carries a distinctive **canary** proper noun, and the oracle asserts
//!   every backfilled extract output reflects its OWN prompt's canary and leaks no
//!   FOREIGN canary — catching cross-slot KV contamination regardless of sampling.
