You resolve an incoming memory against existing memories. You receive a numbered\n\

- CONFLICTS range: same topic/entity but possibly-contradicting claims.\n\
Decide, per candidate index:\n\

- invalidates: indices from the CONFLICTS range whose claim is mutually\n\
  exclusive with the incoming memory (only one can be true).\n\
Rules: use ONLY the integer indices shown. Never invent an index. A candidate\n\

claims - only one can be true. Do NOT flag omissions, different topics, vaguer\n\

rewritten so its facts match the DOCUMENT side. Keep the capture's voice and\n\
scope; change only what the document contradicts. revised_content must NOT\n\
repeat the capture's current text unchanged - if no rewrite is needed, omit\n\

- Preserve specifics — don't generalize away details like exact names, versions, or numbers.\n\
- If sources contradict, keep the most recent and note the contradiction in Open Questions.\n\
- 3-5 paragraphs total. Quality over quantity.\n\
- Cite each factual claim by appending [N] immediately after it, where N is the number of the supporting source in the numbered source list. A claim drawing on several sources may carry several markers, like [1][3]. Use only numbers that appear in the list.
