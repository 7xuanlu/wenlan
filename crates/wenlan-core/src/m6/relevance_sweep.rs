//! The bounded relevance sweep (PR-C slice C1) and its decay reference.
//!
//! # Why the decay reference exists
//!
//! The estimator cells are decayed sums, not counts:
//!
//! ```text
//! contribution(g) = hub_weight(g) * 0.5 ^ (age_days(g) / 180)
//! ```
//!
//! with `age_days` measured from the group's most recent contributing root's
//! `provenance_roots.created_at`. Decay is therefore a function of *(stored
//! root timestamp, evaluation time)* — and nothing in the schema pinned the
//! evaluation time. S0-91 states the oracle as byte equality of a normalized
//! snapshot "at a fixed relevance generation" and S0-92 fixes accumulation
//! order and 9-dp rounding to make that equality exact, but neither pins the
//! *instant*. An incremental update that decays a touched pair to `unixepoch()`
//! at T₁ and a full recompute at T₂ > T₁ produce different cells for every
//! untouched pair, so the oracle would fail continuously for a reason that is
//! not a bug — and fail *later*, looking exactly like an incremental defect.
//!
//! `space_graph_state` cannot supply the pin: it carries no timestamp.
//!
//! **Q1's adjudication: a per-space monotone counter in `m6_counters`, and no
//! migration.** That table is `(space_id, space, name, value >= 0)` with a
//! monotone-on-update trigger, a monotone-on-insert-replace trigger, two
//! identity guards, and a no-delete trigger. A `unixepoch()` stored there is a
//! monotone integer that may never decrease — exactly the safety property a
//! decay reference needs, because a reference that moved backwards would make
//! a pair's decayed weight *increase*.
//!
//! Every incremental update decays to the **stored** reference, never to
//! `unixepoch()`. The reference advances only in a full re-reference pass. The
//! oracle then becomes exact by construction: every row at a given reference
//! decays to the same instant, so incremental and full agree with no tolerance.
//!
//! S0-11 is honored — `unixepoch()` is still evaluated in-statement; it is
//! stored once rather than read per row.

/// row to be stale and the pair is invisible forever. That is not a stale
/// number but a row a full recomputation emits and the incremental table never
/// contains, which is the incremental-equals-full property itself.

/// The second test is `co_supported` below, and its two halves are both load-
/// bearing. It fires only for a page with **no** row, so a page whose rows are
/// current is not re-selected and the turn count still drains. And it counts
/// only pages inside the top-64 cut, because that is the set
