//! Debounced background reflection (T22).
//!
//! When an agent stores many memories in a burst, the per-store detached
//! enrichment spawn (`memory_routes::handle_store_memory`) would otherwise fire
//! N overlapping `run_post_ingest_enrichment` tasks — N classify+extract LLM
//! calls, N page-growth passes — most of which are wasted because a newer write
//! from the same agent lands before the older reflection finishes.
//!
//! [`ReflectionDebouncer`] coalesces those spawns **per agent key**. Each
//! `schedule(key, delay, work)` call cancels the previously-scheduled work for
//! that key, distinguishing two cases so cancellation is always clean:
//!   - **Pre-delay** (work has not started — still inside its debounce `sleep`):
//!     the task is [`tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort`]ed. Nothing has run, so
//!     aborting drops no state.
//!   - **In-flight** (work has started running): the task is NOT aborted.
//!     Instead a shared [`AtomicBool`] is flipped; the running `work` checks it
//!     at clean step boundaries (cooperative cancellation; the actual
//!     checkpoints live in
//!     `origin_core::post_ingest::run_post_ingest_enrichment`) and returns early
//!     without half-applying a step. Aborting a started enrichment is exactly
//!     the half-write risk this design avoids.
//!
//! Only the **latest** write in a burst actually enriches. No write is dropped:
//! cancelling the older reflection only defers it — the newer one supersedes it
//! and enriches the same agent's freshly-written rows.
//!
//! Anti-starvation: a never-settling writer that reschedules the same key
//! forever would never reflect. Only **in-flight** cancellations count toward
//! the streak (a pre-delay abort cancelled work that never ran, so it must not
//! push the key toward a force-run). After [`MAX_CANCELLATIONS`] consecutive
//! in-flight cancellations the next `schedule` force-runs: it still stops the
//! prior task first (abort if it never started, cooperative-cancel if it is
//! in-flight) so the prior and the freshly-spawned task never enrich
//! concurrently — exactly the latest write enriches — then resets the streak so
//! the fresh task is not itself immediately starved. Reflection makes progress
//! under sustained load without ever double-enriching.
//!
//! This struct lives in `origin-server` (the detached-spawn owner). The
//! cancellation *signal* it produces (`Arc<AtomicBool>`) is passed into
//! `origin-core`'s `run_post_ingest_enrichment` as `Option<&AtomicBool>`; core
//! stays framework-agnostic and only sees a plain atomic.
//!
//! No new dependency: built on `tokio::spawn` + `JoinHandle::abort` +
//! `std::sync::atomic::AtomicBool` only (no `tokio-util` / `CancellationToken`).
