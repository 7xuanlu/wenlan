//! Seed-completeness contract (Fowler `ContractTest`).
//!
//! A cached eval "seed" DB is only trustworthy if it is (a) free of duplicate
//! memory rows, (b) fully enriched (every memory classified), and (c) the
//! fixture it claims to be. Historically none of this was checked — only
//! schema-migration replay was.
//!
//! Cautionary note (2026-06-08): an eyeballed analysis of the `lme_v1` seed
//! mis-read multi-chunk storage as duplication (counting `chunk_index>0`
//! continuation rows of long memories) and the NULL importance on those
//! continuation rows as "half-classified". This contract — scoped to memory
//! heads (`chunk_index=0`) — corrected that on its first run: `lme_v1` actually
//! has zero `(source, source_id)` duplicates and is essentially fully
//! classified. That is the whole point of putting the rule in code: a runnable
//! check beats prose. The real risks it still guards: true `(source, source_id)`
//! dupes, incomplete classification, and fixture-identity confusion (the
//! existing `lme_v1` seed is the ORACLE fixture, not the LME-S haystack).
//!
//! This module makes the integrity rule **code, not prose**: a pure-SQL check
//! that runs against any seed DB and fails LOUD on a violation. The cheap
//! pure-SQL nature means it runs in CI (no GPU, no embedder), so a dirty seed
//! fails the build independent of any agent or runbook discipline.
//!
//! It is the gate inside the (forthcoming) atomic seed-build pipeline: build to
//! a temp dir → `assert_seed_contract` → only then atomic-publish to canonical.
//! A broken seed can never become canonical because the gate sits before the swap.
