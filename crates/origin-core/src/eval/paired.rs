//! Per-query emission for paired A/B retrieval evals (validation apparatus v2).
//!
//! The aggregate `run_*_eval_from_db` runners are *deterministic* per
//! `(DB, fixture, flag)` — re-running them gives stddev ≈ 0, which makes a
//! "run N times, take stddev" protocol vacuous. The statistically valid source
//! of variance is **across queries**: a paired per-query test (Wilcoxon signed
//! rank / bootstrap over the per-query Δ) on a single deterministic run.
//!
//! These collector runners mirror the scoring loop of their aggregate siblings
//! but emit one [`PerQueryRow`] per query (with a wall-clock retrieval latency)
//! instead of only the aggregate. The downstream `analyze_paired.py` joins the
//! OFF and ON JSONL arms by `(bench, query_id)` and runs the paired stats.
//!
//! Scaffolding only — not part of the shipped product surface.
