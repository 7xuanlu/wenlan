/** Apps & CLIs group. Every detected client has the same one-click "Set up" —
 *  what that button *does* differs by client, and `isPluginClient` is the only
 *  thing that decides: Claude Code and Codex get the Wenlan plugin (which
 *  registers the MCP server itself), everyone else gets an MCP config write.
 *  Writing a config for a plugin client would register Wenlan twice, so this
 *  surface obeys the same invariant the wizard does.
 *
 *  `connectedFamilies` (the tool families the roster above already shows)
 *  is the single source of truth for what to hide here: a client whose family
 *  already has an identity is represented above, so re-listing it — even when
 *  its own config file looks unconfigured — is the duplication the user
 *  vetoed.
 *
 *  `seenFamilies` is the narrower set whose identities have actually called
 *  Wenlan. It decides Added versus Connected. A tool the user adds from this
 *  list stays in place, saying "Added. Restart it to finish", and flips to
 *  Connected when its family first shows up in `seenFamilies`, instead of
 *  vanishing the moment its config is written. */
