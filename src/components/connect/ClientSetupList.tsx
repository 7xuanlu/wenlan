/** Apps & CLIs group. Every detected client has the same one-click "Set up" —
 *  what that button *does* differs by client, and `isPluginClient` is the only
 *  thing that decides: Claude Code and Codex get the Wenlan plugin (which
 *  registers the MCP server itself), everyone else gets an MCP config write.
 *  Writing a config for a plugin client would register Wenlan twice, so this
 *  surface obeys the same invariant the wizard does.
 *
 *  `connectedFamilies` (the tool families the roster above already shows as
 *  connected) is the single source of truth for what to hide here: a client
 *  whose family already has an identity is represented above, so re-listing
 *  it — even when its own config file looks unconfigured — is the duplication
 *  the user vetoed. */
