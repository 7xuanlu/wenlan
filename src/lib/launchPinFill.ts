 * Fill the unpinned routing jobs once per app launch.
 *
 * Every other fill happens in the webview at the moment a source is turned on:
 * the wizard's model row, the wizard's Done step, and the Settings provider
 * saves. Each retries in JS, and JS does not survive a quit or a reload. So a
 * user who quits during the multi-minute model download comes back to a loaded
 * model, memories saving, and both jobs still unpinned. Nothing compiles, and
 * no later event tries again. This is the retry that outlives that quit.
 *
 * Two conditions, and both are enforced without a second routing read.
 * Setup complete is checked here, through the same command `App` gates the
 * wizard on, so the two cannot disagree about whose screen this is. "A loaded
 * on-device model or a configured provider" is what `pinsToFill` derives from:
 * with no source in the pool it returns nothing to write, and an on-device
 * model that is selected but not loaded does not count.
 *
 * It never runs while the wizard is showing. `App` renders the wizard instead
 * of `Main`, not beside it, so the hook is not mounted then, and the check
 * below covers the fail-closed path where the wizard is shown because the
 * daemon could not be reached at all.
 *
 * Failures are logged, never surfaced: the user did not ask for this write.
