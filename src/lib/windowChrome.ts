/**
 * Where the window's own chrome sits, and how much room the app has to leave
 * for it.
 *
 * macOS draws the traffic lights on top of the webview, because
 * app/tauri.conf.json asks for `titleBarStyle: "Overlay"` and positions them at
 * x=16. Everything the app paints in that corner would land underneath them, so
 * the top bars inset their content past it. Windows and Linux draw a real title
 * bar above the webview instead, so the same inset is just dead space.
 *
 * Read from the user agent rather than @tauri-apps/plugin-os or the daemon's
 * get_system_info: both are async, and these values are needed for the first
 * paint. The webview's user agent is the platform's own, so it reports the host
 * rather than anything the app configured.
 *
 * `hostPlatform` is three-valued, because two values were being spent on three
 * states: a UA that says "Windows" and a UA that is missing or unrecognised are
 * different measurements, and a boolean `isMacOS` answered `false` to both.
 * Every caller here still wants a number or a boolean in the end -- these values
 * decide pixel offsets at first paint, so nothing may wait on an async platform
 * lookup -- but the collapse happens at a named site *per question*, because the
 * three questions do not have the same answer for `unknown`:
 *
 *   - "how much left inset?"   -> `UNKNOWN_PLATFORM_TOP_BAR_INSET`     (macOS's)
 *   - "how tall a drag strip?" -> `UNKNOWN_PLATFORM_DRAG_STRIP_HEIGHT` (macOS's)
 *   - "who paints the shadow?" -> `UNKNOWN_PLATFORM_PAINTS_SHADOW`     (not macOS's)
 *
 * Each is a DECISION about an unmeasured platform, justified where it is
 * declared, and each is pinned by a test so flipping one fails loudly. They do
 * not agree with each other, which is the whole reason they are three sites and
 * not one shared boolean.
 *
 * There is deliberately no exported `isMacOS`. It existed; all three of these
 * questions were answered by calling it; and every one of them therefore
 * inherited `unknown -> false` invisibly -- the exact
 * failed-measurement-as-a-negative this module was split up to remove. Anything
 * new that needs the platform asks `hostPlatform()` and handles all three
 * states, or calls a function below that has already decided.
