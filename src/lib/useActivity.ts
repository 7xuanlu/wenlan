 * Steeping or Blocked, 60 s when Up to date. Only the cadence is spelled
 * here: React Query already suspends `refetchInterval` while the window is
 * unfocused, so adding a focus listener would duplicate that and race it.
 *
 * The interval is the function form, matching SourcesView — it re-reads the
 * cached data on every tick, so the cadence follows the state without the
 * component re-subscribing.
