 * and the whole correction lands on the core: on the real capture a
 * drag-reheat slid the core 776 units up a 3,939-unit span, pulling the two
 * zones apart. Averaging the FREE nodes only cuts that to 371.
 *
 * `retarget()` removes the rest. shelveComponents centres each component by
 * its BOUNDING BOX, which is not where its centroid is; asking the force for
 * a centroid of exactly (0,0) therefore slides a component by the difference
 * on the first reheat. Retargeting after the shelf is laid out tells the
 * force to hold each component exactly where the composition put it, which
 * leaves only the small amount a component genuinely relaxes by.
 *
 * Round 5's live shelf generalizes this from one group to many (see
 * `setGroups`). On the live simulation only the CORE is held this way: a
 * rigid hold corrects position but not velocity, so a group carries whatever
 * momentum the external field gave it into the next tick — negligible across
 * the core's thousands of free nodes, but the dominant error on a handful of
 * nodes sitting thousands of units from the core's mass (measured at capture
 * scale: 28 units of centroid drift over a 60-tick drag reheat). Shelved
 * components are held by `shelfAnchorForce` instead. The many-group form is
 * still what `relaxShelf`'s scratch simulation uses, where every group is a
 * shelf component and there is no distant core to be pushed by.
 *
 * Before `setGroups` is ever called (the pre-shelf settle), every node falls
 * into one implicit group targeting the origin — exactly the old single-group
 * behavior. After it is called, a node no group names is left alone.

 * What holds the shelf together once no component is frozen with fx/fy.

 * Two parts, and both are needed:
 *
 * - A per-node SPRING toward the exact position the packing gave that node.
 *   Unlike a centroid hold this resists rotation and shear as well as
 *   translation, which is what the packed rows actually need: an elongated
 *   component in the core's repulsion field is a body in a radial field, and
 *   it swings to point at the core unless something pulls each end back. Its
 *   centroid barely moves while it does that, so a centroid hold does not
 *   even see it — on the 24/6/5 fixture a five-node chain raised its top edge
 *   9.1 units toward the core over 120 ticks under a centroid-only hold, and
 *   0.75 with these springs. Soft, so a drag still wins locally.
 * - Control of each component's BULK velocity, for components with no hand on
 *   them: whatever link and charge just handed the component as a whole is
 *   replaced by exactly the velocity that carries its centroid back to the
 *   slot, `offset * SHELF_RETURN_RATE`. Only the uniform part is touched — the
 *   part that translates a component without changing its shape — so every
 *   relative motion (a drag pulling a neighbor, collide opening a knot) is
 *   left alone. This is what a spring this soft cannot do on its own: at
 *   capture scale the core's mass accelerates a distant component by roughly
 *   11 units per tick, which a 0.1 spring only cancels hundreds of units away
 *   from the slot. Measured together at capture scale: 28.5 units of drift
 *   under the centroid hold, 0.65 under these two.
 *
 *   Steering home rather than simply zeroing the bulk velocity is what makes a
 *   RELEASE land. Zeroing removes the spring's own return velocity again on
 *   the following tick, leaving only one alpha-scaled impulse per tick to do
 *   the whole journey — and alpha runs out first: a 200-unit drag on a shelved
 *   pair used to settle 77.5 units from its slot, overlapping the core's box
 *   by 13. With the bulk velocity steered home it lands within a unit.
 *
 * A component the pointer is holding is left entirely alone: with one node
 * pinned, "the group's bulk velocity" is mostly the drag response itself, and
 * overriding it would clamp the very neighbors that are supposed to follow.
 * The hand is the constraint while it is down; this force takes over on
 * release. When the release skips the cooling tail altogether (reduced
 * motion), `settle` does the same correction in one step.
