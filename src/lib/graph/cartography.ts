 * - READY (`cartographyBySpace.get(space)?.status === "ready"`): the
 *   daemon's own community_id, namespaced `durable:<spaceSegment>:
 *   <enc(community_id)>`.
 * - a member the daemon's read didn't cover gets its own singleton under a
 *   SEPARATE top-level family, `unassigned:<spaceSegment>:<enc(node id)>` —
 *   never nested under `durable:`, so a daemon-assigned community_id that
 *   happens to spell out the literal string "unassigned:<id>" can't forge
 *   one (see the collision note below).
 * - anything else (not ready — no durable data published yet, or a
 *   partial-error): the client-side fallback climb, namespaced
 *   `fallback:<spaceSegment>:<enc(local id)>`.
 *
 * The space component is the tag-discriminated segment above (`s<enc>` or
 * `u`); community_id and node id are encodeURIComponent-escaped before
 * joining. That does two things:
 *   1. Collision-proofs the join itself — encodeURIComponent never leaves a
 *      literal ":" unescaped, so `<prefix>:<encSpace>:<encRest>` always
 *      splits back into exactly 3 parts; two different (space, id) pairs
 *      can never concatenate to the same raw string the way an unescaped
 *      join would (`("a","b:c")` vs `("a:b","c")`).
 *   2. Keeps the three top-level prefixes (`durable:`, `unassigned:`,
 *      `fallback:`) reserved: since escaped, space/id components can never
 *      contain an unescaped ":", no daemon-controlled string can forge a
 *      different family's prefix.
 * Together, two different spaces' — or families' — community/local ids can
 * never compare equal, so communityRegions can't accidentally group members
 * across a space boundary purely from id collision.
