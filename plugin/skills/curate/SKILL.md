  Power-user audit of Wenlan's pending surfaces: accept, reject, or edit
  unconfirmed captures and pending revisions. Most users want `/brief` for
  revisions; that handles the daily flow. Use `/curate` only for explicit
  deep-walk audits after bulk imports, or when you want to walk the full
  queue rather than the top 3 shown in /brief.
  Invoked as `/curate captures` or `/curate revisions`.

# /curate

Power-user audit lever. Most users do not need /curate in daily flow:

- **Pending revisions** surface in `/brief` automatically (top 3 with inline accept/dismiss).
- **Pending captures from this session** surface in `/handoff`'s preview block (top 3).
- **Orphan wikilinks** surface in `/distill`'s topic-suggestion block.

Use /curate only when you want the deep walk those skills intentionally do not force.

**Captures are meant to decay.** A capture lands unconfirmed and, if nothing ever
conflicts with it, it quietly fades — that is by design, not a backlog you owe the
system. The only items that *need* a human are genuine conflicts (a contradiction,
or a richer re-capture worth merging); those surface as pending revisions in
`/brief`. `/curate captures` is an **opt-in audit** for when you *want* to seal a
batch (e.g. after a bulk import), not a daily chore to zero out.

## Decide in native cards, not prose

Walk the queue with `AskUserQuestion` — the same native picker `/pages` uses.
**Never narrate items one-by-one in chat prose.** A card is a real decision; prose
is a wall of text the user has to reply to by hand.

`AskUserQuestion` takes **up to 4 questions per card** (one per item) and **2-4
options** each, plus an auto "Other" free-text slot. So batch the queue in groups
of ≤4:

1. List the pending items (per section below).
2. Take the next ≤4. Build ONE `AskUserQuestion` call:
   - one **question** per item — `question` is the item's content, trimmed to ~1-2 lines.
   - `header`: a short tag, ≤12 chars (the memory type, or `Capture 3`).
   - `options`: the actions for that section (below).
   - The card always adds an "Other" slot — that is the **edit** path.
3. Apply each answer (below), then repeat with the next ≤4 until the queue is empty.
4. Cancel / close the card = **no mutation**. "Skip" is the safe per-item escape.

## `/curate captures`

`list_pending` lists every unconfirmed memory (pass `space` only if the user named
one, e.g. "curate work captures"; otherwise leave it off for all pending). Each
memory has a `source_id`. Per item, options:

- **Accept** → `confirm_memory(memory_id=<source_id>)`
- **Reject** → `forget(memory_id=<source_id>)`
- **Skip** → nothing
- *Other (typed text)* → edit: `capture(content=<text>, supersedes=<source_id>)`,
  then `forget(memory_id=<source_id>)`.

## `/curate revisions`

The pending-revision surface is now **conflicts and merges only** — a same-entity
contradiction, or a materially-richer re-capture worth folding into the original.
A plain unconfirmed capture never lands here, and a ~identical re-capture dedups
silently (no card). So every revision in this queue is a real decision.

`list_pending_revisions` returns **one row per chunk** — a long revision spans
several rows sharing the same `revision_source_id`. **Group rows by
`revision_source_id` and join their `revision_content` in order**, so each card is
ONE logical revision, not a mid-sentence fragment. `revision_content` (joined) is
the new text; `target_source_id` is the memory it would replace. Per revision,
options:

- **Accept** → `accept_revision(target_source_id=<target_source_id>)`
- **Dismiss** → `dismiss_revision(target_source_id=<target_source_id>)`
- **Skip** → nothing

The item carries the revised text but **not the original**. If the user wants to
compare before deciding, `recall` the `target_source_id` first and show both.
(Surfacing the original inline is a daemon follow-up.)

## Bare `/curate` (no arg) → straight to the picker

No arg means "show me what needs me." Do NOT print this help, and do NOT
auto-walk captures. Go straight to the **revisions** picker, because under the
attention-gate model the only items that need a human are conflicts:

1. Call `list_pending_revisions`. If non-empty → walk it as native cards exactly
   like `/curate revisions` (group rows by `revision_source_id`, ≤4 per card,
   Accept / Dismiss / Skip).
2. If empty → say so in one line ("Nothing needs you — no pending conflicts.")
   and stop. Captures are meant to decay; mention `/curate captures` only as an
   opt-in deep audit the user can run if they *want* to, never as a backlog.

## When to use

- After a bulk import (ChatGPT, Obsidian dump) when you want to audit every
  auto-classification before sealing.
- When `/brief` shows ">3 pending revisions" and you want to clear the full
  queue, not just the top 3.

## When NOT to use

- Daily session work. `/brief` handles the surface that matters today.
- Specific factual lookup: use `/recall`.

## Cost

Read-only until the user picks an action in a card. No LLM calls. Cheap.
