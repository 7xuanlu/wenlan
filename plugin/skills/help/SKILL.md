  One-screen quick reference for the Wenlan plugin. Lists the daily
  verbs, the daily flow, where data lives, and how to view it without a
  GUI. Use when the user says "help", "what can I do", "list wenlan
  commands", "how do I use wenlan", invokes `/help`, or explicitly asks
  about import progress.

# /help

Print the Wenlan plugin reference card. The default help path is read-only and
never calls a tool.

## How to invoke

When triggered, output the block below verbatim. No editing, no
abbreviating, no embellishing. The user is asking for the menu.

```
Wenlan plugin — daily verbs

  /setup        set up or repair Wenlan (auto-installs local runtime)
  /brief [topic] read the current Space Brief; topic adds related context
  /capture <x>  save one durable memory in flow
  /recall <q>   search local memory
  /lint [deep|repair] [scope]   diagnose, or resolve all findings safely
  /distill [t]  synthesize pages from clusters (scoped to current repo)
  /pages [q]    browse + open distilled pages (wenlan pages)
  /curate <surface>   deep audit (surface = captures|revisions); /brief handles daily
  /forget <id>  delete a memory by ID
  /handoff      end-of-session ritual (session log + captures)
  /help         this card

Import progress: ask explicitly; Wenlan checks `list_pending_imports` on demand.

Daily flow (~1 min overhead per session):

  1. start session  →  hook auto-checks runtime, silent if up
  2. /brief         →  resume a project or ask to catch up
  3. work normally  →  Claude proactively /captures durable facts
  4. /recall X      →  as needed for lookups
  5. /handoff       →  ~30 s, narrative session log + captures

Where your data lives (everything under ~/.wenlan/):

  ~/.wenlan/pages/      wiki pages distilled from your memories (md)
  ~/.wenlan/sessions/   session logs by date (md)
  ~/.wenlan/sessions/_status/  human receipts projected from Space Briefs
  ~/.wenlan/db/         memories + knowledge graph (symlink to libSQL)
  ~/.wenlan/bin/        installed binaries

View it without a GUI:

  open ~/.wenlan/                  browse in Finder
  code ~/.wenlan/                  open in VS Code
  git -C ~/.wenlan log --oneline   timeline of every memory + distill pass
  ln -s ~/.wenlan/pages ~/Vault/wenlan   # symlink into Obsidian for graph view

~/.wenlan/ is a git repo. Commits land at session boundaries (handoff
or daemon events), not per capture; uncommitted page edits between
sessions are normal. Use git log / git diff / git revert as a free
audit trail. No remote — purely local history.

Three classes of artifact:
  - memories: granular, queryable, live in DB only (confirmed = stays in DB)
  - pages:    synthesized wikis, DB + ~/.wenlan/pages/*.md projection
  - sessions: chronological narrative, ~/.wenlan/sessions/*.md only

The local runtime must run at 127.0.0.1:7878. Hook prints "Wenlan is not running" and "/wenlan:setup" if down.

Optional upgrades for richer distill cycles:
  wenlan models install           local Qwen, no API cost
  wenlan keys set anthropic       Anthropic API, higher quality

Models and keys do not enable background inference by themselves:
  wenlan steep status             show Everyday + Synthesis as off, ready, or paused
  wenlan steep configure --everyday <source> --synthesis <source>
                                  review the exact mapping, disclosure, and confirm
  wenlan steep disable            turn model-backed background work off
```

## Import progress (explicit only)

Only when the user explicitly asks whether an import/export is still running,
call `mcp__plugin_wenlan_wenlan__list_pending_imports`. Never call it during
ordinary `/help`, `/brief`, setup, or session-start flows.

## When to use

- User explicitly types `/help`.
- User asks "what can I do with wenlan", "list wenlan commands", "how
  does this plugin work", "remind me what verbs are available".
- First session after install — print this once on `/setup` success too.

## When NOT to use

- Specific factual lookup → use `/recall`.
- Setup troubleshooting → use `/setup` (it diagnoses + auto-installs).
