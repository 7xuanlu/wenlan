#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Dispatch the wenlan MCP server.
#
# Resolution order (most specific first):
#   1. Sibling file `scripts/wenlan-mcp.local` next to this script — typically a
#      symlink to a locally-built wenlan-mcp binary. Filesystem-based so it
#      survives plugin reloads that don't re-read settings.json env.
#   2. WENLAN_MCP_DEV_BIN env var (primary) or ORIGIN_MCP_DEV_BIN (fallback) —
#      secondary, kept for shells that already export them. Requires Claude Code
#      to inherit the var at startup. Accepts both for backward compatibility.
#   3. An installed binary, in this order (mirrors the order the Wenlan app
#      uses when it writes its own MCP entry, app/src/mcp_config.rs):
#        a. ~/.wenlan/bin/wenlan-mcp — the path install.sh places binaries at.
#        b. The Wenlan desktop app's bundled copy:
#           Wenlan.app/Contents/MacOS/wenlan-mcp under /Applications or
#           ~/Applications (WENLAN_APP_DIRS, colon-separated, overrides both).
#        c. ~/.cargo/bin/wenlan-mcp — `cargo install`.
#        d. `wenlan-mcp` on PATH, for example from a package manager.
#      Preferred over npx because (a) it's already on disk so MCP host
#      handshake is instant, and (b) it sidesteps the EPERM class of npx
#      failures when ~/.npm/_cacache contains root-owned files left over
#      from older npm versions (npx exits before responding to initialize,
#      MCP host then waits 30s and times out).
#   4. npx -y wenlan-mcp@<exact version> — LAST resort for users with no
#      installed binary at all (it downloads on first use and needs network and
#      a working npm cache). The Claude directory rejects ranges and @latest,
#      so this is a literal pin that the release train rewrites
#      (scripts/bump-version.sh) and checks (scripts/validate-versions.sh).

# Don't enable `set -u` here: if Claude Code (or any MCP host) invokes the
# script through a shell that doesn't populate BASH_SOURCE, `set -u` halts
# before we even get to the npx fallback. Fall back to $0 instead.
