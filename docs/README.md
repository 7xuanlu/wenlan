# Documentation Guide

This directory contains project documentation intended for contributors and maintainers.

## Structure

- `plans/`: historical implementation plans and design snapshots.

## Reading `plans/` safely

Many plan files reflect the architecture at the time they were authored. Some are now superseded by the current daemon-centric layout (`crates/wenlan-types`, `crates/wenlan-core`, `crates/wenlan-server`, `crates/wenlan-cli`). The Tauri desktop app referenced by older plans is the `app/` crate in this monorepo (it lived in a separate `7xuanlu/wenlan-app` repo from 2026-05-07 until it was folded back in on 2026-07-20).

If a plan starts with a **Superseded** note, treat it as historical context rather than current implementation guidance.

## Current sources of truth

- Retrieval, graph, and model details: `technical-foundations.md`
- Contributor workflow and CI commands: `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Detailed developer architecture conventions: `CLAUDE.md`
