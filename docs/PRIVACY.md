# Privacy Policy

Wenlan is a local-first personal memory system. This policy covers everything the project ships: the desktop app, the daemon, the CLI, the MCP server, and the Claude Code and Codex plugins.

## What data Wenlan stores

Only what you explicitly capture: decisions, lessons, observations, project context, and wiki pages synthesized from those memories. Wenlan does not monitor or scrape your machine for material to store.

It does keep a local record of its own use, in two tables of the same database that holds your memories. One table logs actions: searching, storing, refining, and forgetting. Each row names the action, which agent did it, when, which memories were involved, and a short description.

Two of those descriptions carry your own words. A search stores the query you typed. Forgetting a memory stores its title, deliberately, because the memory itself is gone by then and the title could not be looked up later. The other table records which memory was read and when; results that are pages rather than memories are left out of both.

Some of this is cleared as you go: deleting a memory removes its read records, and `wenlan cleanup-legacy-captures` clears both tables. Nothing expires rows with age, so otherwise this history grows for the life of the install. Deleting the database, as described under "Data deletion" below, deletes it too.

One thing is automatic, and you switch it on yourself. When you connect a folder as a source, Wenlan watches it and reads changed files without asking again for each one -- it syncs that folder once at startup and then whenever a file in it changes. Choosing the folder is the consent; each individual file is not a separate prompt.

## Where data is stored

Your data is stored on your machine:

- `~/.wenlan/pages/` -- wiki pages (Markdown)
- `~/.wenlan/sessions/` -- session logs (Markdown)
- `~/.wenlan/sources/` -- uploaded source documents
- `~/.wenlan/spaces.toml` -- Space mapping config
- `~/.wenlan/db/` -- symlink to the platform data directory (macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/wenlan/`; Linux: `~/.local/share/wenlan/`; Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wenlan\`), with the libSQL database at `<data dir>/memorydb/`
- `~/.wenlan/bin/` -- installed binaries
- The desktop app's log, `wenlan.log`, outside all of the above: `~/Library/Logs/com.wenlan.desktop/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/wenlan/logs/` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wenlan\logs\` on Windows. It is a single file that is never rotated or trimmed. It holds diagnostics rather than your memories. It can still name paths of files it had trouble indexing, so read it before attaching it to a bug report. It does not contain the Remote Access identifier; releases up to and including v0.17.4 wrote the full relay address here, which carried that identifier, so a log kept from one of those versions should be deleted rather than shared.

The daemon listens on `127.0.0.1:7878`, which is your own machine only. Nothing you capture -- no memory, page, source, or search -- is sent anywhere unless you turn on one of the features in "Sending your content somewhere" below.

One exception needs nothing turned on. If a note contains a remote image, displaying that note sends the image's address, which came out of your note, to whoever hosts it. See "Images in your notes reach their host" below.

## When Wenlan reaches the network

Wenlan is not fully offline. Three things happen on their own, and each tells the other end your IP address. The first is a download rather than a single request: it fetches the model file plus its tokenizer and configuration files, so expect several requests. Only one of the three has an off switch, noted in the table.

Separately, displaying a note that contains remote images may reach those image hosts. That is described under "Images in your notes reach their host" below. Two more requests happen only when you press something: installing an optional model, covered in "Sending your content somewhere", and installing the Claude Code or Codex plugin from Settings, which runs that client's own CLI and clones this repository's plugin marketplace from GitHub. One more can happen without you pressing anything, in another program: when no `wenlan-mcp` binary is installed, Wenlan writes an `npx -y wenlan-mcp` command into your AI client's configuration, and that client fetches the package from npm the first time it starts.

| What | When | Where | What it sends |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search model download | Once, the first time the daemon starts | `https://huggingface.co`, repository `Qdrant/bge-base-en-v1.5-onnx-Q` | Downloads about 210 MB across several files. Sends no memory content. One caveat: the download library reads a Hugging Face access token from that tool's standard cache directory if you already have one saved on this machine, and attaches it, which identifies your Hugging Face account to them. This model is what makes local search work; without it the daemon cannot start. |
| Desktop app update check | About 3 seconds after launch, then every 30 minutes while the app is running, or when you choose Check for updates. Skipped entirely when the app starts with `WENLAN_DATA_DIR` or `ORIGIN_DATA_DIR` set. | `https://github.com/7xuanlu/wenlan/releases/latest/download/latest.json` | Nothing but the request itself, identified as `tauri-plugin-updater`. If a newer version exists the app asks you; it never installs without your click. Choosing Later suppresses automatic reminders for that version for 24 hours, including across restarts. |
| MCP server version check | Every time an AI client starts `wenlan-mcp`, normally at most once a day | `https://github.com/7xuanlu/wenlan/releases/latest` | Nothing but the request itself, identified as `wenlan-mcp/<version>`. It reads only where GitHub redirects, to compare version numbers. The daily limit is remembered in a cache file; where that file cannot be written, such as a read-only home directory, the limit lasts only for that one process, so each new one can check again. |

To avoid the model download, copy an existing model cache into the daemon's cache directory before first start. To avoid the two version checks, block `github.com` for those processes at your firewall; both fail quietly and Wenlan keeps working.

### Images in your notes reach their host

These requests deserve their own heading, because they are the ones that can reach a server nobody at Wenlan chose, and because a note can produce many of them.

Wenlan renders Markdown, and a Markdown image may point at any address. If a note contains `![something](https://example.com/picture.png)`, **displaying that note tries to load the picture from `example.com`**. Every remote image in a note is a separate load, so a note with ten of them names up to ten hosts, and a redirect can pull in further hosts that the note never named. How many network requests that becomes depends on your browser cache and on those redirects. The desktop app sets no content security policy of its own, so it does not block them, though your network or the webview still might.

A load that does reach the host tells it your IP address, the time, and the address it asked for, which came out of your note. Wenlan adds nothing to that address; the path and any query string already in it are sent, while a fragment after a `#` stays in the browser. A uniquely generated image address therefore works as a read receipt on anyone who opens the note.

It may tell the host more than that. The reading view uses an ordinary image tag and sets nothing on it, so your browser's own defaults decide the rest: it may send cookies that host has already set in this app, subject to the usual same-site and scope rules, and it normally sends a `Referer` naming the app's address rather than the note. The editor sets `referrerpolicy="no-referrer"`, which drops the referrer but does not affect cookies. Exactly what is sent is your webview's behaviour, not something Wenlan controls or can promise.

Reading and editing differ. The reading view builds every image as soon as it renders the note. The editor builds images only for the part of the note on screen, and marks them to load lazily, so an image far below your cursor is not fetched until you scroll to it.

This matters most for content you did not write: a page imported from elsewhere, or a document someone sent you. There is no switch to turn it off.

Nor is there a way to point a note at a picture in your own notes folder. A relative address such as `![x](pictures/photo.png)` is passed through unchanged by the reading view, which resolves it against the app rather than your folder, so your file does not appear; the editor accepts only `http:` and `https:` addresses and skips it. The app can display local files through the mechanism it uses for avatars, which is limited to the folders it is configured for and reaches no network -- on Windows that mechanism produces an address beginning `http://asset.localhost/`, which looks remote but is not. Outside those folders, an image you can see in a note came over the network.

If a note worries you, remove the image link from it.

## Sending your content somewhere

These are off until you turn them on. Aside from the remote images described above, which need nothing turned on, they are the ways your captured content leaves your machine that we know of.

- **A cloud AI provider (bring your own key).** If you save an API key and pick that provider for enrichment, Wenlan sends the text of the memory or document being processed, plus its prompt, to that provider. Anthropic goes to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`. Any other provider goes to the endpoint you entered -- the app offers presets for OpenAI, Google, Groq, OpenRouter, Mistral, DeepSeek and xAI, and an endpoint on your own machine such as Ollama stays local. What that provider does with the text is governed by its own terms. Read them rather than assuming: several of these companies say their consumer privacy policy does not cover text submitted through their API, and point to a separate business or API agreement instead. Your key is stored in the local config and sent only to that provider. Turn it off with `wenlan enrichment disable`, or by clearing the key.
- **Testing a provider.** The "test endpoint" button sends one fixed sentence, `Say 'hello' and nothing else.`, and the model-list button asks the provider what models it offers. Neither sends anything you captured.
- **Remote Access (experimental, desktop app only).** When you turn it on, the app runs `cloudflared` to open a tunnel to the local MCP server so Claude.ai and ChatGPT can reach a stable address, and registers that address with Wenlan's relay at `https://origin-relay.originmemory.workers.dev/register`. The registration sends the tunnel address and a random 16-byte identifier that Wenlan generates once and keeps on disk; that identifier is used as both the account name and the shared secret. While it is on, the app checks the tunnel's health every 30 seconds. **The address has no login: anyone who has it can read and write your entire memory** until you turn Remote Access off. Nothing is sent while it is off.
- **On-device model download.** If you run `wenlan models install` or start the download from Settings, a Qwen model is fetched from `https://huggingface.co`. This is separate from the search model above and does not happen on its own. Once installed, enrichment runs on your machine and the text being enriched does not leave it.
- **Better search ranking.** If you turn on the reranker, its weights are downloaded from `https://huggingface.co` the next time the daemon starts, between roughly 146 MB and 1.1 GB depending on which one you choose. It is off unless you set it.

## Telemetry

None is sent anywhere. No analytics or crash reporting runs in a build you install: Wenlan operates no analytics service, files no crash reports, and sends no diagnostics. The app's fonts are bundled rather than fetched.

One caveat about the dependency list, since it is public and you may read it. A development-only profiling tool, React Scan, pulls crash-reporting packages into the lock file. It is loaded only in a development build, behind two environment flags, and is not part of a release.

The one thing Wenlan does record about your use is the local activity history described under "What data Wenlan stores", which stays in the database on your machine.

Opening a window starts the update check listed in the table above about three seconds later. On a first run it also triggers the search model download in that table, and if you left Remote Access on, it reopens that tunnel. Beyond those, see "Images in your notes reach their host" above, because the note you open can reach the network on its own.

## The other companies involved

Wenlan reaches these services, so their own terms decide what they do with the request. None of them reports back to us about you. The one place the project can see anything at all is Cloudflare's own dashboard for the relay, which shows traffic figures for that service. One of them is not merely reached: Wenlan's relay runs on Cloudflare Workers, so the project holds a Cloudflare account and is bound by Cloudflare's own terms as a customer.

| Service | Why Wenlan reaches it | Their policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub | The two version checks, downloading a release, and installing the Claude Code or Codex plugin from Settings, which clones this repository's plugin marketplace | [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) |
| Hugging Face | Downloading the search model, and any optional model you install | [Hugging Face Privacy Policy](https://huggingface.co/privacy) |
| npm, which GitHub operates | Only when no `wenlan-mcp` binary is installed, in which case your AI client runs `npx` to fetch it | [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement) |
| Cloudflare | Only if you turn on Remote Access, which runs `cloudflared` to open the tunnel | [Cloudflare Privacy Policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) |
| The host of a remote image in one of your notes | Displaying a note whose Markdown points at a remote image | Whoever runs that host. Wenlan cannot know who that is |

### The cloud AI providers Wenlan offers

None of these is contacted unless you save a key and choose that provider for enrichment. Wenlan ships a preset for each one, so each one's published privacy policy is named here.

**Read one thing before relying on the table.** Wenlan talks to these providers through their APIs, and several of them state in the very policies below that the policy does not cover content submitted through an API by a business or developer customer. Anthropic, OpenAI and Groq each say a version of this and point to a separate customer or API agreement instead; xAI states the exclusion without naming the document that replaces it. Whichever agreement applies is what actually governs the text Wenlan sends, and it was accepted by whoever created the key -- you, or the organization that issued it to you. Find it on the same provider's legal page; we deliberately do not guess which version applies to your account.

| Provider | Their policy |
| --- | --- |
| Anthropic | [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy) |
| OpenAI | Published per region: [rest of world](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/), [United States](https://openai.com/policies/us-privacy-policy/), [Europe](https://openai.com/policies/eu-privacy-policy/) |
| Google, for Gemini | [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) |
| Groq | [Groq Privacy Policy](https://groq.com/privacy-policy) |
| OpenRouter | [OpenRouter Privacy Policy](https://openrouter.ai/privacy) |
| Mistral | [Mistral Privacy Policy](https://legal.mistral.ai/terms/privacy-policy) |
| DeepSeek | [DeepSeek Privacy Policy](https://cdn.deepseek.com/policies/en-US/deepseek-privacy-policy.html) |
| xAI | [xAI Privacy Policy](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy) |

Wenlan also offers presets for Ollama and LM Studio. Wenlan sends those requests to an address on your own machine, so nothing you capture leaves it by that route; what those two programs do on their own is up to them, not something this project can promise. There is also a custom option where you type the address yourself. For a custom address, the policy is whatever the operator of that address publishes.

Wenlan's own relay, at `origin-relay.originmemory.workers.dev`, is run by this project rather than a third party. It is meant to hold the tunnel address you register and the random identifier described above, and nothing more. Its source is not part of this repository, so that is a statement of intent you cannot check against the code here. It runs on Cloudflare Workers, so Cloudflare sees the requests as the platform underneath it.

## Data deletion

- Delete individual memories: `/forget` skill.
- Delete everything: remove `~/.wenlan/` and your platform data directory (`~/Library/Application Support/wenlan/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/wenlan/` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\wenlan\` on Windows). An install upgraded from Origin still holds a full copy of its data in `~/.origin/` and in the sibling `origin` data folder (`~/Library/Application Support/origin/` on macOS, `~/.local/share/origin/` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\origin\` on Windows); delete or copy those two as well. Three things sit outside all of those:

  - `~/.config/wenlan-mcp/` holds the Remote Access identifier, which doubles as that feature's shared secret, and the MCP bearer token if you generated one. Neither is removed with the folders above.
  - If you pointed the knowledge or page path at a folder of your own, your pages are in that folder, not under `~/.wenlan/`.
  - Registering a Remote Access tunnel leaves a record on the relay. Turning Remote Access off stops the tunnel on your machine; the app sends no request to remove the registration. Open an issue if you want it deleted.
  - The log file listed under "Where data is stored" is in none of those folders and is not removed with them.
  - Wenlan writes an entry for itself into the configuration of each AI client you connect -- Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini, Codex. Those entries stay after uninstall, and the client will keep trying to launch Wenlan. Remove them by hand. The command-line tool also leaves a timestamped backup of each file it edited, beside the original.
  - An install upgraded from Origin may also have `~/.config/origin-mcp/`, holding that version's identifier and token.
- Uninstall the daemon: run `wenlan background off` to stop it and disable autostart (this is a reversible runtime stop, not an uninstall), then remove the service registration for your platform -- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wenlan.server.plist` (macOS), `~/.config/systemd/user/wenlan-server.service` (Linux), or the `WenlanServer` scheduled task (Windows) -- and delete `~/.wenlan/bin/`.
- **Uninstall the desktop app:** turn off *Run Wenlan in background at login* in Settings and quit the app (this removes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wenlan.server.plist` and `com.wenlan.desktop.plist` on macOS), then delete `Wenlan.app`; on Windows run the uninstaller from Apps & features. The data folders above stay until you delete them.
