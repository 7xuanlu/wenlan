"""Behaviour cases and negative controls for the Windows first-run gauntlet probes.

Two things, in the order that matters:

  1. CASES -- drive the shipped probes and the shipped `Check` blocks that call
     them, over stubbed cmdlets, and assert the row each records.
  2. CONTROLS -- revert ONE property of one remedy in a copy of the source,
     re-run the cases, and fail when the case that defends it stays green.

THE SUBJECTS are scripts/first-run/windows-zip.ps1, windows-nsis.ps1 and
lib.ps1. lib.ps1 is driven exactly like the channels: `Get-HealthReachability`
does not classify its exception itself but asks lib.ps1, and the CIM witnesses
and `Get-DirPresence` are defined there once instead of once per channel.
Unstubbed they would trip the stub-escape guard; unmutatable, the rules inside
them would have no control defending them anywhere. A control whose subject is
lib.ps1 still reddens the cases of a CHANNEL, because lib.ps1 has no rows of its
own, and which channel is DERIVED from the control's own must_fail list.

THE DEFECT EVERY CASE HERE IS ABOUT is a FAILED measurement that reads as a
NEGATIVE one. The shapes it takes, as rules rather than as history:

  A PROVIDER THAT FAILED IS NOT AN EMPTY TABLE. `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue`
      on Get-NetTCPConnection or Get-Process returns, when the provider fails,
      exactly what a closed port and a dead process return -- so ONE broken read
      passes two rows meant to be independent evidence.
  AN EXCEPTION WITH NO Response IS NOT A REFUSAL: a DNS failure, a TLS failure,
      a timeout and a malformed URI all reach `catch` without one, as a refused
      connection does.
  A RESET IS NOT A REFUSAL EITHER, and this one is MEASURED: a TcpListener that
      accepts and closes with LingerState(true, 0) -- indisputably UP -- produces
      WebException/ReceiveFailure wrapping IOException wrapping
      SocketException/ConnectionReset. Only ConnectionRefused is the negative.
  A TRI-STATE THAT DIES AT A CALLER BOUNDARY IS NOT A FIX: three outcomes in,
      one printed line and $LASTEXITCODE 0 out. The probe returns its state and
      every call site records a row.
  A TRI-STATE THAT DIES INSIDE THE CALLEE IS NOT ONE EITHER, by three routes.
      NATIVE STDERR, measured on the reference host: `& cmd.exe /c "echo x 1>&2
      & exit /b 0" 2>&1 | Out-Null` sets `$?` False under `Continue` and THROWS
      System.Management.Automation.RemoteException under `Stop`, and `schtasks
      /end` writes a benign stderr line when the task is not running -- so a
      probe can throw on its first statement and never reach `return`. Hence
      `Invoke-Native`, which pins the preference in its own dynamic scope, keeps
      stderr as text and hands the exit code back as data. A BARE CAST:
      `[int]"unknown"` on a malformed listener row throws rather than returning.
      AN UNBOUNDED OVERRIDE: a health timeout with a floor but no ceiling lets an
      inherited GAUNTLET_HEALTH_TIMEOUT_SEC=86400 make the twenty-attempt stop
      loop effectively non-terminating.
  A WITNESS THAT DOES NOT CO-VARY WITH WHAT IT RATIFIES IS NOT A WITNESS: "is
      this a process table" (pid 4 present, ten rows) cannot ratify "wenlan-
      server is not in it", because the targeted read can throw its absence error
      while the whole-table read CONTAINS the process.
  A WITNESS MUST NOT QUERY THE PROVIDER WHOSE FAILURE IT CLAIMS TO DETECT. The
      port witness is `netstat -ano` (iphlpapi, no CIM, no WMI); the process
      witness adds Win32_Process (WMI's winmgmt service). Neither witnesses
      against the KERNEL, and both say so in the source.
  A CONTROL THAT CANNOT FAIL IS NOT A CONTROL: a process-table fixture that is
      BOTH too short AND missing pid 4 tests neither witness alone.
  A CONSTANT A NEGATIVE DEPENDS ON IS A MEASUREMENT, AND SOMETHING MUST OBSERVE
      IT. -TimeoutSec is 5 rather than 2 because a refused loopback connect takes
      ~2.05 s on the reference host (Windows retries the SYN), so `-TimeoutSec 2`
      turns every genuine refusal into a Timeout and the negative becomes
      unreachable in principle. The slow-refusal stub below observes the
      constant; a stub that ignores TimeoutSec leaves it unpinned.
  OWNERSHIP IS MEASURED, NEVER ASSUMED. `Get-Process -Name wenlan-server |
      Stop-Process -Force` selects EVERY process with that name, and `schtasks
      /delete /tn WenlanServer /f` removes a registration this run may never have
      made. Ownership is by image path AND by "was it already running", and the
      task is ended and deleted only when the name was free before the run
      started. Likewise "the daemon stopped" is the owned-process poll, not one
      ConnectionRefused: a failed kill, or a survivor that merely unbound 7878,
      refuses too.

WHY THE SUBJECT IS EXTRACTED RATHER THAN RUN. Neither channel script can be
executed here at any cost: each calls `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force` on
%LOCALAPPDATA%\\wenlan, which on a developer machine is the real memorydb, config
and logs. So the probe functions and the `Check` blocks that call them are
extracted by brace matching and evaluated in isolation -- the same reason and
technique as `dev-runtime-scan-controls.sh`, which extracts `reap_staged_daemon`
because `dev-runtime.sh` dispatches on "$1" and cannot be sourced. Nothing here
installs, uninstalls, binds a port, kills a process, or writes outside a
temporary directory.

WHAT MAKES THAT A GUARANTEE RATHER THAN A HABIT is that the extraction guard is
an ALLOW-LIST per invocation construct, not a list of forbidden names. A guard
recognising a command held in a variable and nothing else accepts `& ("Remove-" +
"Item") -LiteralPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\wenlan" -Recurse -Force` -- which
contains no banned token anywhere -- and accepts
`[System.IO.Directory]::Delete(...)` and `(Get-Item $p).Delete($true)` as well.
The call operator, the `::` static member and the `.X()` instance call are the
only ways extracted PowerShell can invoke anything, and each is pinned to the set
the shipped text actually uses. See the block above CALL_TARGET_ALLOWED for what
that does and does not cover.

WHAT IS STUBBED, NAMED SO NO READER HAS TO INFER IT:
  Get-NetTCPConnection, Get-Process, Invoke-WebRequest, Get-CimInstance -- the
      measuring cmdlets. Each case says which state it makes them produce.
  netstat.exe and schtasks.exe -- the measuring NATIVE commands, reached through
      the shipped `Invoke-Native`.
  Start-Sleep -- a no-op, so the shipped ten-second poll loops are measured for
      their BRANCHES rather than for the wall clock.
  Stop-OwnedServerProcess and Stop-ProcessByImage -- the shipped KILLERS, and a
      SAFETY REQUIREMENT rather than a convenience: both end in
      `[System.Diagnostics.Process]...Kill()`, so a driver that reached an
      unstubbed one would kill a real process on this machine. They are stubbed
      as RECORDING no-ops so a case can assert what the shipped code decided to
      kill, and `GetProcessById`/`.Kill()` are refused in extracted text so a
      future edit cannot move a real kill into an extracted region.
  Stop-Process -- still stubbed and still in MUST_BE_STUBBED although neither
      channel calls it any more, so a regression that brings it back cannot reach
      a real process on its first run.
  Check, Record-Row, Reached and Test-SingleStatementBlock -- lib.ps1's own
      judging rule, MODELLED rather than summarised, including `-ExpectFail`, the
      reach witness, the single-pipeline AST fallback, and rc=2 for the third
      state. A replica that declares `-ExpectFail` and never reads it judges the
      one shipped row asserting a REFUSAL by the rule for rows asserting a
      success, so the replica's parameter set and rule anchors are compared
      against lib.ps1 on every run (SHIPPED_CHECK_RULES) and its outcomes are
      driven in real processes and then made to come out wrong
      (REPLICA_MUTATIONS).
  wenlan.exe -- the product CLI, including the `recall` verb the -ExpectFail row
      runs, so a refusal after `background off` can be told from an answer.

THE STUBS ARE CHECKED TO STILL BE THE STUBS, by the guard emitted into every
driver. Measured on the reference host: auto-importing a module that exports a
same-named function REPLACES a script-scope stub, so after the first
`NetTCPIP\\Get-NetTCPConnection` call the name resolves to the real provider and
the driver silently measures the developer's machine instead of the fixture. The
TCP stubs therefore capture their one real error BEFORE they define themselves,
and the guard refuses to run a `Check` block if any stubbed name has escaped.

The ABSENCE arms do not fabricate an exception: the stub replays a real one --
for processes by calling the real cmdlet for a process that genuinely does not
exist, for ports by re-throwing an ErrorRecord captured from the real provider --
so the id the fix keys on is PowerShell's, not this file's.

ONE STUB RUNS A REAL NATIVE COMMAND, named here rather than buried:
`schtasks-native-stderr-under-stop` invokes `cmd.exe /c "echo ... 1>&2"`, because
a PowerShell FUNCTION cannot produce a NativeCommandError and the native-stderr
rule above is about nothing else. It echoes; it changes nothing.

WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE: that the gauntlet installs, uninstalls, or reaches a
daemon. No product code runs here at all.

# alone, so the one shipped row that asserts a REFUSAL
# -- `stopped-marker-error (wenlan.exe recall x)` -- was judged by the rule for
# rows that assert a SUCCESS, which fails every nonzero block, including the
# refusal that row exists to require. A parameter accepted and ignored is worse
# than one not accepted at all: the call site reads as measured.
#
# The authority is scripts/first-run/lib.ps1, Record-Row through Check -- the shell/release lane's
# file, read here and never edited. What is modelled, and must stay modelled:
#
#   * `$script:CheckReached` and `Reached`, the witness that execution actually
#     reached the construct under test before the expected failure happened;
#   * `Test-SingleStatementBlock`, the AST fallback that lets a block which is
#     one simple pipeline witness itself, because there is no earlier statement
#     that could have thrown the expected text first;
#   * the `$phase` / `$faultedIn` split, so a fault raised by the harness's OWN
#     output capture is not read as the block under test failing;
#   * rc = 2, THE THIRD STATE. lib.ps1 has three outcomes and only two status
#     words available, because `first-run-gauntlet.yml` asserts the PASS|FAIL|INFO
#     vocabulary and `summary.py` reads it; so "unmeasured" rides in the rc
#     column as 2, with an `unmeasured:` prefix on the detail. The replica
#     carries it the same way and publishes it as `RC[n]` on the ROW so a case
#     can assert on it -- otherwise the third state would arrive here as a
#     plain FAIL and this harness would have reproduced, in its own model of
#     Check, the exact confusion Check was changed to prevent.
#
# DOCUMENTED RESIDUAL -- the parts of the shipped Check the replica does NOT
# model, and why each is a deliberate omission rather than an oversight:
#
#   * The LEDGER. lib.ps1's `Record-Row` appends `channel<TAB>name<TAB>status<TAB>rc<TAB>detail`
#     to a file the workflow later parses. The replica's `Record-Row` prints one
#     ROW line to stdout instead, because that is what this harness's
#     `classify_driver_output` reads. All four facts survive; the transport does
#     not, and nothing in any case turns on the transport.
#   * The PER-CHECK LOG. `Set-Content -Path (Join-Path $script:GauntletOut ...)`
#     needs `$GauntletOut`, a directory the shipped script creates on the machine
#     under test. A harness whose entire premise is that the channel scripts are
#     never executed must not start creating their output tree, so this one line
#     is dropped. Consequence, stated rather than hidden: a defect that broke
#     only the log write would not be visible here.
#   * `Assert-RowName` and the row-name registry, which live outside Check and
#     govern which names may be recorded, not how a check is judged.
#
# AND ONE THING THAT LOOKS LIKE A RESIDUAL AND IS NOT. `$rc` now also comes from
# `$LASTEXITCODE`, exactly as upstream, which is what makes `-ExpectFail` mean
# anything at all: a native command that exits nonzero is the only way a shipped
# block reports a refusal without throwing. That could have turned every row red
# here, because several stubs below leave `$LASTEXITCODE` nonzero on purpose --
# and it does not, for a reason worth writing down: every shipped native call
# goes through `Invoke-Native`, which sets `$global:LASTEXITCODE = 0` after
# capturing the code (windows-zip.ps1:138-140, commented there as "the stale rc must
# not leak into the next Check block"). The one bare native call in either
# channel is `& wenlan.exe`, which is the call this rule is for.
#
# And the drift itself is now measured rather than reviewed: `check_param_drift`
# below compares this replica's parameter set against the shipped Check's on
# every run, and `SHIPPED_CHECK_RULES` requires each rule named above to still
# be present in BOTH. The next parameter added upstream is a red run here, not a
# reviewer's lucky catch.

#
#     SETUP-THREW\tRuntimeException: unrelated harness failure
#     ROW\tprobe-row\tPASS\tthe expected detail
#
# was `fail` -- and inside a control, a `fail` on a must_fail case is a control
# that FIRED. `SETUP_CLOSE` wraps the WHOLE transitive setup operation, so any
# mutation anywhere under it produces the marker, and every control whose
# must_fail list mentions a row with a setup line could be satisfied by an

# refused to be ABSENT from the row. The positive direction needs no marker

# ROUND 6 (Codex Sol), RANKED #1: THE EXTRACTION GUARD WAS A DENY-LIST WITH
# THREE DOORS LEFT OPEN, and this guard is the only thing between the driver
# and %LOCALAPPDATA%\wenlan.
#
# The dynamic-invocation ban recognised exactly `& $var` (optionally `& $var
# @splat`). Every one of these read straight past it, past the substring ban,
# past the alias scan and past the reachability scan, and every one of them
# deletes the developer's real memorydb:
#
#     & ("Remove-" + "Item") -LiteralPath "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\wenlan" -Recurse -Force
#     [System.IO.Directory]::Delete("$env:LOCALAPPDATA\wenlan", $true)
#     (Get-Item $p).Delete($true)
#
# The first is a command name built at run time -- there is no `Remove-Item`
# token anywhere in it. The second and third never name a command at all.
#
# A deny-list cannot close this: the set of spellings that resolve to a
# destructive call is not enumerable (string concatenation alone makes it
# infinite). An ALLOW-LIST can, because the extracted surface is small and
# measured. Three constructs are the only ways extracted PowerShell can invoke
# anything, and each now has its own allow-list, DERIVED FROM THE SHIPPED TEXT
# ON THIS REVISION and refusing everything else:
#
#   1. the call operator `&`      -> CALL_TARGET_ALLOWED
#   2. a static .NET member `::`  -> STATIC_MEMBER_ALLOWED
#   3. an instance method `.X()`  -> INSTANCE_METHOD_ALLOWED
#
# WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT COVER, stated because the comment it replaces
# claimed a coverage it did not have. These scans are LEXICAL and run over
# non-comment lines; they are not a PowerShell parse. A property ASSIGNMENT
# with a side effect (`$x.Enabled = $true` on a COM object) invokes nothing
# syntactically and is not seen. Neither is a destructive cmdlet whose name
# arrives as a `-Name` parameter to something already allow-listed. What is
# closed is every route from extracted text to a CALL: no `&` except the pinned
# Invoke-Native body and stubbed executables, no Invoke-Expression, no
# `.Invoke(`, no `::Create`, no Add-Type, and Invoke-Native's own argument
# pinned to two quoted literals. There is no evaluator left inside the
# allow-lists, which is the property the extraction depends on.

# `&` may name a command LITERALLY only if that command is a function the
# driver defines. Derived from MUST_BE_STUBBED rather than hand-listed, for the
# reason the reachability scan already gives: a hand list is the thing that
# goes stale the day someone adds a call. Today this is
# {schtasks.exe, netstat.exe, wenlan.exe}; the shipped text uses only
# `& wenlan.exe background on|off`, and a bare `& schtasks.exe /end|/delete` is
# refused a second time by FORBIDDEN_IN_SOURCE.

# THE REPLICA IS A REPLICA, AND lib.ps1 IS THE AUTHORITY.
#
# ROUND 6, found by the shell/release lane. The `Check` in PREAMBLE is a model
# of `scripts/first-run/lib.ps1`'s `Check`, and for a whole review cycle it
# modelled a DIFFERENT contract: it declared `-ExpectFail` and never read it.
# Nothing here noticed, because nothing here compared the two. A reviewer did.
#
# That is the wrong place for the check to live. A replica silently diverging
# from the thing it replicates is exactly the failure this directory exists to
# catch -- a measurement that has stopped measuring while still reporting -- so
# it gets measured, on every run, in two ways that fail differently:
#
#   * the PARAMETER SET. `Check`'s parameters are its interface; a parameter
#     added upstream that the replica does not declare means shipped call sites
#     this harness would drive through a rule it has never seen, and a parameter
#     the replica declares that upstream does not have means cases written
#     against a rule the gauntlet does not run.
#   * the RULES. A parameter set can match while the body's rules do not, so
#     each construct the replica claims to model has an anchor that must be
#     present in BOTH bodies. Present upstream and missing here is drift; present
#     here and missing upstream is a model of something that no longer exists.
#
# Neither is a substitute for the cases; both are cheap, and both fail loudly at
# the pre-check rather than quietly at review time. Both are made to fire in
# `self_check` below, against fixtures, because a comparison that is silent on a
# healthy tree every single run is a comparison nobody has ever watched refuse.
#
# lib.ps1 is read here and NOWHERE mutated: no control touches it, and this file
# never writes it.

    reverts nothing, and its red would read as a caught defect.

    Returns one of "parses" / "syntax" / "unmeasured", plus detail.

    The third value is the point. `returncode == 0, else it did not parse` reads
    a verdict off an exit status alone, so a powershell.exe that never got far
    enough to open the file -- process-table pressure, a transient CreateProcess
    failure, a timeout -- arrives as `syntax error` and every control in the run
    is scored as a failure. That is not hypothetical: a full sweep of this
    directory produced `CONTROL FAILURES: 113`, every line reading `the mutant
    does not parse, so it reverted nothing:` with an EMPTY reason, minutes
    before the identical revision ran standalone at `CONTROL FAILURES: 0`. The
    empty reason was the tell -- a real parse error prints its line and message.

    So a syntax verdict now needs BOTH the exit status the checker reserves for
    it AND the diagnosis it always prints alongside. Anything else is a
    measurement that did not happen, and says so.

    ROUND 5 (Codex Sol), FINDING 2. "The diagnosis it prints alongside" used to
    be spelled `out.strip()` -- any output at all. That is three-valued
    syntactically and binary semantically: a checker that printed "PowerShell
    host initialization failed" and exited 1 without ever looking at the file
    was called a syntax measurement. Nonempty output is not proof the PARSER
    diagnosed anything. PARSECHECK's contract is one `line <n>: <message>`
    record per syntax error, so that shape -- PARSE_DIAGNOSIS below -- is what
    a syntax verdict now requires. A noisy exit 1 without it is unmeasured.
