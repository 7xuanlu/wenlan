# First-run gauntlet: the `wenlan` CLI round-trip against a running daemon —
# status, capture a sentinel, memories lists it, recall finds it (polled up
# to 60s). Lifted from scripts/smoke-cli.sh; every step is recorded through
# lib.sh and the script never exits early, so one broken step still lets the
# later ones report. Always exits 0 — the channel script calls `evaluate`.
#
# Env:
#   WENLAN_BIN    path to the wenlan binary (required)
#   WENLAN_HOST   daemon URL; leave unset to exercise the CLI's own default
#   GAUNTLET_OUT / GAUNTLET_CHANNEL   see lib.sh
