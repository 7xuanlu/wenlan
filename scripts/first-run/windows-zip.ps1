#       -> THREW System.Management.Automation.RemoteException, and the function

# record in the PowerShell error stream. `schtasks /end` writes a benign line
# there when the task is not running -- the common case, since this runs at
# cleanup -- so under an inherited `Stop` preference `Stop-Daemon` throws ON ITS
# FIRST STATEMENT and the tri-state its two callers branch on is never
# returned. THE TRI-STATE DIES INSIDE THE CALLEE. This script never sets `Stop`
# itself, but $ErrorActionPreference is DYNAMICALLY SCOPED: a wrapper, a
# dot-source or a CI shell that sets it owns every frame below it, and a probe
# that is only correct because of what its caller happens to prefer is not a
# probe. And when it does NOT throw, the other outcome stands: `| Out-Null`
# destroys the text and `$LASTEXITCODE = 0` afterwards destroys the status.
#
# So: the preference is pinned HERE, where dynamic scoping makes it cover the
# call whatever the caller set; the output is turned into plain strings before
# it leaves; and the exit code is read explicitly and handed back as data.

# and the stop-wait loop effectively non-terminating. A gauntlet that hangs

# Tri-state health probe: reachable / down / unmeasurable.
#
#   A FAILED MEASUREMENT MUST NEVER BE INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM A NEGATIVE ONE.
#
# The two-state form this replaces was:
#
#     catch { return ($null -ne $_.Exception.Response) }
#
# Every exception carrying no Response returned $false -- and $false was also
# what a refused connection returned. A DNS failure, a TLS failure, a timeout, a
# malformed URI, a probe that never left this process: all of them spelled
# "the daemon is down". `health-unreachable-after-off` therefore PASSED when the
# HTTP probe itself broke, certifying a shutdown nobody measured. Same defect as
# the `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` port probe below, in a different tool.
#
# ONLY A REFUSED CONNECTION IS `down`. That is the daemon answering the question
# by not being there; everything else is the question not being asked.
#
# THE TABLE BELOW WAS MEASURED ON THE WRONG EDITION. It is correct for Windows
# PowerShell 5.1 and this script is run by first-run-gauntlet.yml with
# `shell: pwsh`, which is PowerShell 7, where Invoke-WebRequest is built on
# HttpClient and raises none of these types. The verdict logic now reads the
# exception SHAPE through Get-WebExceptionShape / Test-ConnectionRefused /
# Test-HttpErrorResponse in lib.ps1, whose header carries the re-measured table
# for both editions. This one is kept because the reasoning under it -- why a
# reset is not a refusal, why ConnectFailure alone is not enough -- is what
# those helpers implement, and it is edition-independent.
#
# MEASURED ON THIS HOST (Windows PowerShell 5.1.26100.9278), because a
# classification built on guessed exception classes measures nothing:
#
#   closed loopback port  -> WebException Status=ConnectFailure (2),
#                            InnerException SocketException/ConnectionRefused
#                            (10061), Response null
#   unresolvable host     -> WebException Status=NameResolutionFailure (1)
#   live server, HTTP 500 -> WebException Status=ProtocolError, Response NON-NULL
#   "notaurl:::"          -> NotSupportedException -- not a WebException at all
#   ""                    -> UriFormatException
#
# A RESET IS NOT A REFUSAL, and the earlier form treated the two as one
# negative. A reset is what a LIVE peer does: a proxy, a firewall, a load
# balancer, or an HTTP service that is up and falling over mid-response. It
# says something was there to slam the door, which is the opposite of the claim
# `health-unreachable-after-off` makes. Measured here, on a TcpListener that
# accepts and closes with LingerState(true, 0) -- a listener that is
# indisputably UP:
#
#   live listener that RSTs -> WebException Status=ReceiveFailure (3),
#                              InnerException System.IO.IOException,
#                              and only INSIDE that, SocketException/
#                              ConnectionReset (10054)
#
# Two things follow. First, `ConnectionReset` never belonged in the negative:
# with it there, a live listener resetting the gauntlet's probe certified that
# the daemon was gone while it was still on the port. Second, the socket error
# is not always $we.InnerException -- here it sits one layer deeper -- so the
# chain is walked. That is for the DETAIL; the verdict still requires
# ConnectFailure, whose inner SocketException is direct.
#
# ConnectFailure alone is not enough either: it also carries NetworkUnreachable
# (10051) and HostUnreachable (10065), which say the path is broken, not that
# the daemon is gone. Only ConnectionRefused (10061) is the door being answered
# with a slam. Everything else -- including a ConnectFailure that carries a
# reset, which a proxy can produce -- is unmeasurable.
#
# The catch is deliberately untyped and classifies on $_.Exception itself: a
# typed `catch [System.Net.WebException]` would not cover the UriFormatException
# and NotSupportedException arms above, and an arm that is not covered here
# falls to the default -- which is unmeasurable, the safe direction.

#                 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
#     if ($open.Count -ne 0) { throw ... }
#
# `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` turns EVERY failure of the TCP provider into
# an empty array, and an empty array is what a genuinely closed port also
# produces. A CIM server that is down, an unloaded NetTCPIP module, a WMI
# repository hiccup: `$open.Count -eq 0`, no throw, and the row PASSES. The
# gauntlet's last act is to certify that it left no daemon behind on the
# developer's shared production port, and it certified that by failing to look.
# This is verbatim the defect scripts/first-run/port-precheck.sh was written to
# close at the START of a run -- the same cmdlet, the same flag, quoted in that
# script's header -- reintroduced at the END of the same run.
#
# THE TABLE IS THE PRIMARY READ, like the netstat parse in
# scripts/lib/host-process.sh: the whole listener table is fetched and then
# asked about the port, rather than the provider being asked about the port
# directly. That is what makes it self-validating -- a table that came back is
# evidence the provider answered, so its shape can be checked before it is
# believed, and a per-port query has no shape to check.
#
# MEASURED ON THIS HOST: `Get-NetTCPConnection -State Listen` returns 39 rows
# (29 distinct ports, 135 and 445 among them) and 217 rows unfiltered. Asking
# instead about a single free port throws CimJobException with
# FullyQualifiedErrorId `CmdletizationQuery_NotFound,Get-NetTCPConnection` --
# so on the per-port form even the negative arrives as an exception, and telling
# it from a provider failure means parsing an error id. That is why the per-port
# form is the WITNESS below and not the primary read: alone, "an error came
# back" cannot be told from "the provider broke", which is the whole defect.
# Together the two are a measurement neither is on its own.
#
# THE RESIDUAL THAT USED TO BE STATED HERE -- a provider that returns a
# well-formed but INCOMPLETE table, since there is no socket that must appear in
# every listener table the way pid 4 must appear in every process table -- is
# put to the witness below. It has to be: the shape of the table says the
# PROVIDER answered, but 38 rows about other people's sockets are not evidence
# about ours, so a table-only negative is ratified by a second read.
#
# The other stated cost stands: a host with NO listening TCP socket at all
# answers "unmeasurable" rather than "free", because the empty-table case is
# indistinguishable from the provider failing. That is the safe direction, and
# on Windows it is not reachable in practice -- the RPC endpoint mapper and
# svchost listen before a login shell exists.
#
# THE WITNESS, AND WHY IT IS NOT Get-NetTCPConnection ANY MORE.
#
# The previous witness asked `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $Port` -- the same
# cmdlet, the same NetTCPIP cmdletization, the same CIM session, the same
# MSFT_NetTCPConnection provider as the table read it was ratifying. Round-3
# review, verbatim: "the port and process witnesses query THE SAME PROVIDER
# whose failure they purport to detect." That is exactly right, and it is worth
# being precise about what it could and could not do. It DID catch a targeted
# read that disagreed with the table (a per-connection race, a filtered view)
# and a targeted read that failed with an unexpected error id. It could NOT
# catch the case it was written for: one provider-level fault -- a stale
# cmdletization cache, a CIM session that has lost half the instance set, a WMI
# repository serving a plausible subset -- omits our socket from the table AND
# answers CmdletizationQuery_NotFound to the targeted query. Both reads agree,
# both are wrong, and `port-7878-closed` passes over a live daemon.
#
# So the witness is now `netstat -ano`, which is a DIFFERENT PROVIDER.
#
# HOW MUCH OF THAT IS MEASURED, since the distinction matters: what this run
# established is that netstat is a separate PROCESS whose output does not come
# through the cmdletization/CIM path at all, and that the two disagree in shape
# (one prints text rows, the other returns instances). The next sentence's
# account of netstat's internals -- iphlpapi's GetExtendedTcpTable -- is
# documented behaviour taken on trust, NOT something measured here; nothing in
# this repo inspects netstat's imports. The independence claim rests on the
# separate process and the separate transport, which are observable; the API
# name is offered as explanation, not as evidence.
#
# a native executable calling GetExtendedTcpTable in iphlpapi.dll, with no CIM session,
# no WMI repository and no cmdletization layer anywhere in it. A fault in any
# of those breaks one read and not the other, which is what makes disagreement
# between them information.
#
# WHAT IT STILL CANNOT WITNESS AGAINST, stated rather than implied: both
# providers ultimately enumerate the SAME kernel TCP table. A kernel- or
# driver-level omission -- a filter driver hiding a socket, a rootkit -- hides
# it from both. This witnesses against PROVIDER failure, not against the kernel
# lying, and no read available from user mode would do better.
#
# The parse is the one scripts/lib/host-process.sh already argues for, ported:
#
#   EVERY non-blank line must BE a row -- TCP with five fields, UDP with four,
#       a numeric pid last -- except netstat's own preamble before the first
#       row (the banner and the column header, both localised, so they can only
#       be counted). A status-0 `WARNING: partial results` merged beside real
#       rows begins with neither protocol name, so a parse that only inspected
#       lines already starting TCP/UDP never looked at it and reported a
#       truncated remainder as a measured negative.
#   ANY STDERR IS A REFUSAL, and the two streams are kept apart to make that
#       readable. Invoke-Native no longer flattens an ErrorRecord into a line
#       of output, so `$r.ErrorCount` is a fact about which stream a line came
#       from. This is not a refinement of the rule below, it is what makes the
#       rule below possible: a preamble that must tolerate two unmatchable
#       localised lines cannot also be the filter that catches a diagnostic
#       standing among them.
#   THE PREAMBLE IS A SHAPE, NOT A BUDGET. `netstat -ano` prints blank, banner,
#       blank, header, rows. The header is therefore the LAST non-blank line
#       before the first row -- the line whose columns this parse is about --
#       and at most ONE other non-blank line may precede it, the banner, which
#       must be SEPARATED FROM THE HEADER BY A BLANK LINE. A bare count of two
#       was the defect: `WARNING: provider returned partial results` directly
#       on top of the header is two non-blank lines too, fits the budget
#       exactly, and a reviewer used it to get a port reported measured closed.
#       Neither line can be matched by text; the blank line between them is not
#       localised. A preamble with no non-blank line at all is also refused --
#       nothing there carries the columns.
#       THE RESIDUAL OF THIS RULE, stated: a stdout warning that mimics the
#       banner's exact shape -- one non-blank line, a blank line, then the
#       header -- is indistinguishable from the banner and is admitted. In that
#       position the banner IS a line of localised prose, so nothing in the
#       stream separates them. What closed the reviewer's case is that a
#       diagnostic must now be POSITIONED like a banner to survive at all, and
#       that netstat's diagnostics go to stderr, which is refused outright.
#   LISTENING IS NOT A KEY. netstat's State column is localised -- German
#       Windows prints ABHOEREN -- so the structural rule is used instead: a
#       listening socket is the TCP row with a WILDCARD foreign address, because
#       a connected one names its peer.
#   A UDP ROW IS THE END WITNESS. `netstat -ano` prints the whole TCP table and
#       then the whole UDP table, so a UDP row is evidence the stream got past
#       every TCP row there was; without one the table may have stopped early,
#       and every remaining row still validates. The ordering that inference
#       rests on is checked rather than assumed: a TCP row after a UDP row is a
#       stream this argument does not apply to.
#   At least one listening row must exist somewhere in the table, so a netstat
#       whose columns have moved is unmeasurable rather than empty. Same stated
#       cost as above, same reason it is unreachable on Windows.
#   THE RESIDUAL, stated: a hole in the MIDDLE of the TCP section is invisible
#       here -- the UDP rows after it still arrive -- and so is a short TCP
#       section, because netstat has no row that must appear in every table.

# --- WHAT THIS RUN OWNS ----------------------------------------------------
#
# The form this replaces was:
#
#     & schtasks.exe /end /tn WenlanServer 2>&1 | Out-Null
#     Get-Process -Name wenlan-server -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue |
#         Stop-Process -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Out-Null
#
# `-Name wenlan-server` SELECTS EVERY PROCESS WITH THAT NAME and the pipeline
# force-killed all of them. A developer's production daemon, another worktree's
# dev daemon, a hand-started wenlan-server: this run started none of them.
# `/tn WenlanServer` is the same defect in the task namespace, and the cleanup's
# `schtasks /delete /tn WenlanServer /f` then removed the developer's
# registration for good. That is a defect in the SHIPPING gauntlet, not in a
# harness around it, and it is the reason an unstubbed control run could stop a
# real daemon.
#
# Ownership is measured now, before anything is started, and it is two facts:
#
#   THE IMAGE. A wenlan-server running from anywhere but this run's own
#       $InstallDir\wenlan-server.exe belongs to somebody else, whatever it is
#       called. Same reasoning as kill_by_image_path in
#       scripts/lib/host-process.sh: every wenlan-server on the machine shares
#       one image NAME, so the name cannot tell them apart and the PATH can.
#
#   AND THE PID WAS NOT ALREADY RUNNING. The image test alone is not enough in
#       THIS channel, and that is the trap worth naming. The zip flow installs
#       to the DOCUMENTED per-user location, %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\wenlan --
#       which is exactly where a developer's production install lives, so their
#       daemon's image path is identical to ours. The one thing that separates
#       them is that theirs was already running when this script started.
#
#       ROUND 6 NAMES WHAT THAT PAIR IS AND IS NOT. "Our image, and a pid that
#       was not in the startup snapshot" is a CORRELATION with "this run
#       started it", not the thing itself, and it is wrong in both directions:
#
#         Not ours, and killed. Anything that starts a server from that same
#         path AFTER the snapshot gets a pid the snapshot cannot contain. The
#         developer's own daemon restarting mid-run does it -- their scheduled
#         task firing, `wenlan` autostarting on a CLI call in another terminal,
#         or them simply restarting it -- and so does a second gauntlet run.
#         All of them look exactly like this run's own child.
#
#         Ours, and spared. Windows reuses pids, and the snapshot is a list of
#         NUMBERS with no birth time in it. A pre-existing server that exits
#         during the run frees its pid; if this run's own server is later given
#         that number, it matches $PreexistingServerPids and is left running --
#         which is the direction that makes `daemon-stopped-at-cleanup` and
#         `port-7878-closed` disagree with each other.
#
#       The safe direction is the second one -- sparing something is
#       recoverable, killing the developer's daemon is not -- and that is the
#       direction the unmeasurables already resolve to. Closing the first would
#       take a fact the pid pair does not carry: the process's own start time
#       compared against this run's, or a parent chain back to this script.
#       Neither is read here, so this is a residual, not a solved problem.
#
#   THE TASK. `WenlanServer` is named by the PRODUCT -- `wenlan background on`
#       registers that spelling -- so this run cannot scope the name to itself.
#       What it can establish is that the name was FREE before it started, which
#       is the only available evidence that the registration now present is the
#       one this run made. A task that already existed, or a presence that could
#       not be measured, is NOT OURS: not ended, not deleted, and said out loud
#       rather than done quietly.
#
# Every one of these is tri-state, and every unmeasurable resolves to NOT OURS.
# The cost of that direction is a FAIL row. The cost of the other direction is
# the developer's daemon.

# Every wenlan-server this user can see, with the image each is running from.

# Is a scheduled task registered? Tri-state: present / absent / unmeasurable.
#
# `schtasks /query /tn <name>` cannot answer this. It exits 1 both when the task
# does not exist and when the query itself failed, and the only thing separating
# the two is an ERROR line that is LOCALISED. Reading that status as "absent" is
# precisely how this run would come to believe it had registered a task that was
# already there -- and then delete the developer's.
#
# So the WHOLE task table is the read, for the same reason the whole listener
# table is: a table that came back is evidence the service answered, and it can
# be checked for shape before it is believed. Every Windows install carries
# tasks under \Microsoft\Windows\ from setup onwards; that is this table's pid 4,
# and the folder path is a literal, not a localised string.
# The INDEPENDENT read of the same question, and the reason the row floor below
# is no longer asked to do a job it cannot do.
#
# PROVIDER INDEPENDENCE: `schtasks.exe` is a native binary driving the Task
# Scheduler COM interface; `Get-ScheduledTask` is a CIM-cmdletized function over
# the `MSFT_ScheduledTask` class in root/Microsoft/Windows/TaskScheduler,
# serviced by winmgmt. Different process, different transport, different failure
# modes. MEASURED on this host: 286 schtasks CSV rows against 207
# Get-ScheduledTask objects -- they do not even agree on cardinality, because
# schtasks prints one row per TRIGGER and CIM returns one object per TASK.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT WITNESS AGAINST, stated rather than implied: both ultimately
# consult the same Task Scheduler service. A service-level omission hides a task
# from both. This witnesses against one PROVIDER failing or truncating, which is
# the round-4 finding, not against the scheduler itself lying.
#
# NOTE the auto-import hazard: `Get-ScheduledTask` is CommandType=Function from
# module ScheduledTasks (measured), not a Cmdlet -- so a test double for it is a
# function that a module auto-import can silently REPLACE. The harness guard
# that requires each stub to be a Function with an EMPTY ModuleName is what
# catches that; it is the same NetTCPIP hazard, and it applies here too.

    # Round-5 review is right: `$rows.Count -lt $w.Count` is a NECESSARY
    # condition and nothing more. schtasks prints one row per TRIGGER and CIM
    # one object per TASK, so the two counts are not comparable in the first
    # place -- with CIM at 207 and a whole table of 286 trigger rows, a
    # well-formed 220-row PREFIX satisfies `220 -ge 207` while dropping 66 rows,
    # and a name below the cut reads as absent from a table nobody established
    # was whole. Two truncated reads that agree on an absence then authorise
    # registering over a task that is really there.
    #
    # So the comparison is between SETS OF NAMES, which is what completeness
    # actually means: every task the independent enumeration lists must appear
    # among the names schtasks printed. A prefix cannot satisfy that without
    # containing everything the other provider saw.
    #
    # MEASURED ON THIS HOST: schtasks /query /fo CSV /nh printed 286 rows naming
    # 207 distinct tasks; Get-ScheduledTask returned 207; the two name sets are
    # equal, with nothing on either side the other lacks.

    # THE RESIDUAL, and it is not small, so it is stated rather than left to be
    # inferred from the word "completeness". This test is INCLUSION, and it is
    # exactly as complete as the witness it includes AGAINST. Every task CIM
    # lists must appear among schtasks' names -- so a schtasks table missing a
    # task CIM saw is caught, which is the truncated prefix this replaced a row
    # floor for. What it cannot see is a task NEITHER provider lists. Both are
    # asking the Task Scheduler service, so a folder this user may not
    # enumerate, or a scheduler that quietly drops a subtree, is absent from
    # both name sets, the sets agree, and the table passes as whole. The
    # measurement above says these two providers agree ON THIS HOST; it does
    # not say either of them saw every registration on it. That is the same
    # shape as the netstat residual in scripts/AGENTS.md -- no row must appear
    # in every table, so no table can be proven complete from inside itself --
    # and the honest form of the claim is: schtasks' table is not a truncated
    # prefix OF WHAT GET-SCHEDULEDTASK CAN SEE.
    #
    # $Name ITSELF IS EXCLUDED from this comparison, deliberately. Whether the
    # target is present is the question this function exists to answer, and it

    # NO ANALOGOUS BINDING EXISTS FOR THE REGISTRATION, and this is where that
    # is said rather than left for the next reader to assume one is there.
    #
    # The two directory trees get a run-scoped GUID marker: this run writes a
    # fresh GUID into the tree and refuses to delete anything it cannot read
    # that GUID back out of (see WHAT BINDS A TREE TO THIS RUN, beside
    # Get-DirPresence). Round-5 review asked for the same for the scheduled
    # task -- the definition XML or the registration date, captured here and
    # re-verified before `/end` and `/delete`. There is no cheap one, and the
    # reason is MEASURED ON THIS HOST rather than assumed:
    #
    #   Export-ScheduledTask returns the definition, and its
    #   RegistrationInfo/Date is AUTHOR-SUPPLIED metadata carried INSIDE that
    #   definition -- not a receipt the scheduler stamps at registration.
    #   Four of the six root-path (`\`) tasks on this machine have no Date
    #   element at all; the one that has it carries whole-second resolution
    #   ('2026-08-31T03:54:10'); and three sibling \Microsoft\Windows\ tasks
    #   share ONE identical Date to the tick, because it was written once by
    #   whoever authored them.
    #
    # So the XML is identical across two registrations of the same definition
    # -- which is exactly the replacement such a check would have to detect:
    # the developer, or a second gauntlet run, executing `wenlan background on`
    # again between this read and the teardown. It would refuse nothing it
    # ought to refuse, while reading like a guarantee.
    #
    # Nor can this run WRITE a mark into the task the way it writes one into a
    # directory. It does not author the definition -- `wenlan background on`
    # does -- and editing the registration afterwards would both mutate the
    # very object under test and write to the developer's task scheduler, which
    # is the thing the safe default here forbids.
    #
    # What the registration has instead is the two-provider agreement below,
    # and that is a weaker fact, not the same one. THE RESIDUAL, stated: between
    # this post-read and the teardown, a registration this run did not make
    # could be standing at this name, and this run would end and delete it.
    # Deleting a registration is RECOVERABLE -- `wenlan background on` puts it
    # back -- and destroying %LOCALAPPDATA%\wenlan is not. That asymmetry is
    # why the trees got a marker and this did not; it is not a claim that the
    # race is closed.
    #
    # ROUND 6, A6 narrowed WHEN the licence is spent without closing what it is
    # a licence FOR. `$TaskOwned` is now re-measured immediately before the two
    # teardown acts that destroy state on the developer's machine -- the cleanup
    # `wenlan background off` and `schtasks /delete` -- so those two rest on a
    # reading taken at the moment of the act rather than one taken before a
    # dozen intervening CLI checks. THE TWO PLACES IT IS NOT RE-READ, and why:
    #
    #   `schtasks /end` inside Stop-Daemon. Ending a run of a task is the
    #   least destructive of the three acts -- it stops an execution, it does
    #   not unregister anything, and the next trigger starts it again -- and
    #   Stop-Daemon is called from two places on a path where an extra table
    #   read costs a full `schtasks /query /fo CSV` plus a Get-ScheduledTask
    #   enumeration each time.
    #
    #   The `background-off` CLI row above. It runs `wenlan background off`,
    #   which is the same act as the cleanup one, and it has the same staleness.
    #
    # Both are the same residual as the paragraph above: a registration this
    # run did not make, standing at this name, ended or switched off by this
    # run. The re-reads below do not fix that either -- a re-read establishes
    # that SOMETHING is registered here right now, never that it is ours. What
    # the re-reads do close is narrower and worth having on its own: acting on
    # a name that has since gone, and acting on a name nobody can read.
    # OWNERSHIP, measured after the fact rather than inferred from the pre-state.
    # Round-4 review: "the result of the registration operation does not flow
    # into that decision". It does now -- the name must have been free before
    # AND a task must be measurably there after. A `background on` that failed
    # while something else claimed the name leaves this false, and a post-read
    # that could not be taken leaves it false too, which is the safe direction:
    # the run declines to touch a task rather than guessing it is its own.
