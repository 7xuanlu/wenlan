# Every measurement here is TRI-STATE: measured / negative / could not measure.
# A check that cannot run FAILS; it never reads as a negative. That is what the

#
# Windows notes, all additive — POSIX behaviour is unchanged:
#   * `mktemp -d` gets an explicit template on every path (macOS mktemp ignores
#     TMPDIR without one, the sandboxed dev loop can only write under TMPDIR,
#     and TMPDIR is unset in Git Bash), and the resulting MSYS path is converted
#     with `native_path` at the DAEMON boundary only: the shell's own `rm -rf`
#     still needs the MSYS spelling. Two variables, never one rewritten variable.
#   * `$!` is an MSYS job pid; `kill -9` on it reaches the MSYS wrapper, not
#     necessarily the native daemon. Both pids are kept and the stop goes through
#     the identity-checked `force_terminate_process`, never pid alone.
#
