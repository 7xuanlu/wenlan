//! On-demand respawn of the wenlan-server sidecar (Diagnostics "Start Wenlan").
//!
//! `setup()` spawns the daemon once. If it dies later — e.g. an ephemeral
//! launchd job killed at logout — the app had no way back, and the Diagnostics
//! "Retry" button only re-probes. This module factors that one-time spawn into
//! [`spawn_daemon_sidecar`] and adds a guarded command that reuses it, so a
//! daemon-down red becomes healable from the UI.
//!
//! It does NOT manage the launchd plist: when launchd owns the daemon we defer
//! to it rather than fighting it with a second process.
//!
//! A sidecar this app spawned is this app's to stop: the child handle is kept
//! and [`stop_sidecar`] *tries* to end it on quit, and on Windows the process
//! is bound to a kill-on-close job object so a hard kill of the app takes it
//! too. Neither clause is categorical — a bind can fail, and so can a stop —
//! so both outcomes are values rather than log lines: [`JobBinding`] on the
//! handle, readable through [`sidecar_job_binding`], and
//! [`SidecarStopOutcome`] returned from every stop and readable through
//! [`last_sidecar_stop`]. Nothing may assume either guarantee held without
