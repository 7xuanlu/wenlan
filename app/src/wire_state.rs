//! `wire_state()` — the real, resolved wiring of Wenlan on this machine:
//! whether the daemon answers, which `wenlan-mcp` binary would actually be
//! written into a client config (plus the full candidate trail, missing
//! paths included), and per-client MCP routing. Single source of truth
//! behind the onboarding wizard's "Setting up" step and Settings →
//! Diagnostics.
//!
//! The bug this exists to make visible: the app once resolved `wenlan-mcp`
//! to a maintainer's cargo build output, wrote that absolute path into a
//! user's `claude_desktop_config.json`, and the binary was later deleted by
//! `cargo clean`. Claude Desktop failed with "cannot connect mcpserver
//! wenlan" and nothing in the app surfaced it. A trail that only lists paths
//! that exist can't show a missing one — so `mcp_binary_wire` below keeps
//! every candidate `mcp_config::wenlan_mcp_candidate_sources` returns,
//! existent or not.
